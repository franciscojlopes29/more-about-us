**Testimonials from our students:**

"The way the course modeule is broken down and also the hiring aspect, I love it."

"The best part about crystalize is I get to learn from a curated resource and to move forward with other hard working and talented dev students. Shout out to the crystalize team who strive to improve students experience and Pradhumna for always being there to mentor and making sure that we understand and be able to implement what we learnt."

"Positivity, motivation and engagement. It's been a great journey so far and the credit goes to the organizers and the amazing mentor (Prad). He has been very active throughout and loves to help the students. It feels like a closely knit group of friends working together to achieve something big."

"Having mentors and students you can reach out to when you have issues and also, helping out fellow students helps a lot with your own understanding of the resources."
